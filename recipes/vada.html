    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p><em>"I once had a picture of vada on my bedroom in which I would pray to before sleeping every day."</em> - Curtis Stone</p>
    <p>A deep-fried fritter made with urad dal and spices.</p>

    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cups of urad dal or uddina bele</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup of channa dal or kadle bele</li>
        <li>2 tsp of rice flour</li>
        <li>2 green chillies</li>
        <li>3 tbsp of coconut (chopped)</li>
        <li>a few curry leaves</li>
        <li>1 tbsp coriander leaves (chopped)</li>
        <li>1 inch ginger (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>A pinch of hing</li>
        <li>Table salt</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and soak dal in about 3 cups of water for about 2-3 hours.</li>
        <li>Drain all the water from soaked dal. Grind urad dal and channa dal together to smooth paste using very little water. An authentic grinding stone can be used, but a wet grinder or even a mixer grinder can also be used.</li>
        <li>The batter should be thick and use very little water. The right consistency is very important or otherwise, you will not be able to get the vada shape.</li>
        <li>Add coriander, green chilli, ginger and chopped dry coconut to the batter. Mix it very well.</li>
        <li>Add 2-3 tsp of rice flour. Rice flour is added to make it crispy.</li>
        <li>Add a pinch of hing to make it more digestable.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a frying pan in medium flame. Wet your palms and take a lemon size batter.</li>
        <li>Make a hole in the centre and slide it into the hot oil. The vada should float on top of the oil.</li>
        <li>Make sure your oil is not too hot. Otherwise the vadas would not cook evenly.</li>
        <li>Fry on both sides till it becomes golden brown in colour.</li>
        <li>Serve medu vada immediately with chutney or sambar of your preference.</li>
    </ol>
